[**BibleQuiz**](https://justineuro.github.io) is meant as a question-and-answer familiarizer of Holy Scriptures.  This repository contains the `src` folder that was used for generating the Android app using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

A demo can be found at [https://justineuro.github.io/BibleQuiz](https://justineuro.github.io/BibleQuiz).  A pre-release Android app is available: [biblequiz-v.0.0.0-pre-release.apk](https://github.com/justineuro/BibleQuiz/releases/download/pre-release-v.0.0.0/biblequiz-v.0.0.0-pre-release.apk).
